# ql-system-builder

a small interactive utility to quickly generate quicklisp project skeletons. not meant to be comprehensive in any way, just cover my (and possibly your) most common use cases. i might write a non-interactive command-line interface, but honestly, i can probably provide much better ergonomics using a custom curses-based tool.
